## Data Visualization

This data visualization was developped as part of a project within the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center. The purpose of this visualization is to provide hands on exploration of Fisheries injury and fatality data to industry stakeholers. For the purpose of privacy, we do not display data in this visualization for fewer than 5 incidents per category. This limits some of the viewing options.

## How to Explore

There's a lot you can do with the __Fisheries Dashboard__. Here's a few suggestion to get started:

* Change the range of years you are interested in visualizing.
* Select specific geographic localities.
* Select specific injury types.
